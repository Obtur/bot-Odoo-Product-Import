# bot-Odoo-Product-Import
Selenium bot made to improve the act of importing products into the Odoo module Point of Sale

##THIS PROJECT WAS BORN ONLY AFTER, TIRELESSLY, TRYING TO USE THE STANDARD IMPORT OPTION OF ODOO MODULE/APP 'POINT OF SALE'.

MAKING USE OF THE PHP FUNCTIONS 'base64_encode' AND 'file_get_contents' TO TRANSFORM AN IMAGE INTO BINARY CODE AND GERERATING A FILE CSV.

ALWAYS RETURN :

"Unknown error during import: <class 'binascii.Error'>: Incorrect padding at row 3
Resolve other errors first
(4 more) Unknown error during import: <class 'binascii.Error'>: Incorrect padding at row 4 Resolve other errors first "

ONLY WHEN MAP AN IMAGE FIELD WITH THE IMAGE BYNARY COLUMN
